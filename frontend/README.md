## My Fullstack App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Fullstack App project. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and interacts with the backend API to provide a seamless user experience.

### Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
  - `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
  - `app.js`: The main JavaScript file that handles client-side logic.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```
   cd my-fullstack-app/frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Usage
